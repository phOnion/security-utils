# Onion Framework Security components and utils

A set of Security components to be used with the `onion/framework` or independently (where possible)

The package is to be designed in such a way that allows independant use of the components(interoperbility?).

# ToDo:

 - [ ] General Encryption helpers :wip:
 - [ ] JWT :wip:
 - [ ] Decorators for transparently handling encryption/decryption

Possibly implement annotations to make it absolutely transparent to the consuming objects as well
as isolate it from implementations as much as possible (although annotations will need to be defined
somewhere, but there is no magic way to solve all problems magically)
